### Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular app.

In this day in age, there are that many streaming platforms that I couldn't name them all on two hands, and what comes with that is the seperation of hundreds if not thousands of movies and television shows that only supply certain streaming platforms. This problem has become incredibly annoying and for a lot of people, very expensive! 
<br>
But what If you could figure out a smart plan of attack on what streaming platform you should subscibe to for each month of the year, think of the amount of money saved and the time saved on only watching the movies/tv shows you like! Well thats where StreamPlanner comes into help. I'm building this application to help with this problem, and hopefully save the users money in the longrun. The application will take in input of that genres of movies and tv shows you like, figure out which streaming platform has the most hits with the genres, and tell you which streaming platform is the one for you. It will also give you movies soon to be added to the platform aswell incase of wanting to stay with them for another month. 

### Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Most households would have more than 1 streaming platform, just because one has different films/shows that others don't, or some movies are only on for a certain time, and having more than 1 platform generally means more spending! So Id like to save the users money, where somebody can save money and think smarter on which platforms should be bought per month.
